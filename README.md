Fit a logistic regression model to predict customer default risk using backwards selection and LASSO. 
Achieved relatively high predictive power. Check report for details.

## Assignment description

You are acting for a consultancy firm and have been asked by a Taiwanese Credit Card Company‡ to help them to predict customers who are likely to default on their credit card.
You have been provided with two sample data sets of customers who have a credit limit that is equal or greater than TN$250,000. (TN$ are Taiwanese dollars.) 

As this information is confidential you have been provided with a historic data set in order to demonstrate “proof of concept”. 
If your firm is successful it will be commissioned in the future to provide modelling services for current data. 
The aim is to build a model that is able to predict which customers are likely to default on paying their card bills. 
This can be later used to build a suitable score card for customers applying for a card or for further credit on their card. 
It is important for the company to be able to explain the justification for refusing someone credit and therefore as well as a model that is able to predict, they are interested in the interpretation of the model.
